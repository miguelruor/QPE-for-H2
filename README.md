# Quantum Phase Estimation for Molecular Ground State Energy

This project implements the **Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)** algorithm using [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/), with a focus on computing the **ground state energy of the hydrogen molecule (Hâ‚‚)**. It includes both classical and quantum simulations and visualizations.

## ðŸ§  Main Features

- âœ… General QPE circuit construction (`circuit_qpe`)
- âœ… Classical computation of eigenvalues for verification
- âœ… Decomposition of the Hâ‚‚ Hamiltonian using the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation
- âœ… Efficient 2-qubit simulation by exploiting Hartree-Fock state symmetries
- âœ… Trotter-Suzuki approximation for time evolution
- âœ… Energy surface generation (exact & QPE-estimated)
